# Resume

My resume, version-controlled and generated as a PDF on tag releases.

## Setup

**1. Clone the repo.**
```bash
git clone <your-repo>
cd <your-repo>
```

**2. Make sure Docker Desktop is installed and running (for local generation).**

---

## Fork and use your own resume

**1. Fork the repo and clone your fork.**

**2. Replace `resume.json` with your own data.**

**3. Enable GitHub Actions + Pages in your fork.**
- Repo → Settings → Actions → allow workflows
- Repo → Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions

**4. Tag a release to generate your PDF.**
```bash
git tag vYYYY.MM.DD
git push origin vYYYY.MM.DD
```

Your PDF will be available at:
- `https://<OWNER>.github.io/<REPO>/resume.pdf`
- GitHub Releases → latest tag asset

---

## How it works

```
edit resume.json → push tag → GitHub Actions runs
→ Docker spins up RxResume → imports JSON → exports PDF
→ PDF uploaded to the GitHub Release for that tag
```

---

## Branching strategy

Each branch can be a different tailored version of your resume:

| Branch | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main` | Latest general resume |
| `frontend-focused` | Tailored for frontend roles |
| `senior-roles` | Tailored for senior positions |

Each tag has a PDF attached in GitHub Releases.

## Manual PDF generation

If you need to regenerate the PDF locally:

```bash
# Make sure Docker is running first
python3 scripts/generate_pdf.py resume.json output/resume.pdf
```
